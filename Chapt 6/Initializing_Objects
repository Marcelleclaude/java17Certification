Initializing Classes
Initialize Class X
1. If there is a superclass Y of X, then initialize class Y first.
2. Process all static variable declarations in the order in which they appear in the class.
3. Process all static initializers in the order in which they appear in the class.

IMPORTANT!! a class must be initialized before it is referenced or used. Also, the class containing the program
entry point,
 aka the main() method, is loaded before the main() method is executed.

rule: by the time the constructor completes, all final instance variables must be assigned a value exactly once
public class MouseHouse {
 private final int volume;
 private final String name;
 public MouseHouse() {
 this.name = "Empty House"; // Constructor assignment
 }
 {
 volume = 10; // Instance initializer assignment
 }
}

Initialize Instance of X
1. Initialize class X if it has not been previously initialized.
2. If there is a superclass Y of X, then initialize the instance of Y first.
3. Process all instance variable declarations in the order in which they appear in the class.
4. Process all instance initializers in the order in which they appear in the class.
5. Initialize the constructor, including any overloaded constructors referenced with this().

IMPORTANT!!! . Remember, constructors are executed from the bottom up, but since the first line of every constructor is
a call to another constructor, the flow ends up with the parent constructor executed before
the child constructor.

We conclude this section by listing important rules you should know for the exam:
■ A class is initialized at most once by the JVM before it is referenced or used.
■ All static final variables must be assigned a value exactly once, either when they
are declared or in a static initializer.
■ All final fields must be assigned a value exactly once, either when they are declared, in an
instance initializer, or in a constructor.
■ Non-final static and instance variables defined without a value are assigned a
default value based on their type.
■ Order of initialization is as follows: variable declarations, then initializers, and finally
constructors.

Inheriting Members
    -Overriding a Method
overriding a method occurs when a subclass declares a new implementation for an inherited method
with the same signature and compatible return type.

When you override a method, you may still reference the parent version of the method
using the super keyword
To override a method, you must follow a number of rules. The compiler performs the following checks when you override
a method:
1. The method in the child class must have the same signature as the method in the
parent class.
2. The method in the child class must be at least as accessible as the method in the
parent class.
3. The method in the child class may not declare a checked exception that is new or
broader than the class of any exception declared in the parent class method.
4. If the method returns a value, it must be the same or a subtype of the method in the parent class, known as covariant
return types.
While these rules may seem confusing or arbitrary at first, they are needed for consistency.
Without these rules in place, it is possible to create contradictions within the Java language.
5. The method defined in the child class must be marked as static if it is marked as
static in a parent class

Rule #1: Method Signatures
If two methods have the same name but different signatures, the methods are overloaded, not overridden.
-Overloading differs from overriding in that overloaded methods use a
different parameter list

LET'S DO A QUICK REVIEW:
Method Overloading: is when you have multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.
for example:
class Calculator {
int add(int a, int b) {
return a + b;
}->here as you can see there is 2 ass method with different parameter types(int and double)
double add(double a, double b) {
return a + b;
}}

Method Overriding:is when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its
superclass.
for example:
class Animal {
void makeSound() {
System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
}}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {-> override the method with the same name in animal class.
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }}

EXAMPLE:
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound(String sound) {
        System.out.println("Dog barks: " + sound);
    }
    @Override ->to indicate that we are overriding the makeSound method from the Animal class. This means we provide
    a specific implementation for the makeSound method in the subclass that replaces the implementation in the superclass.
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal genericAnimal = new Animal();
        genericAnimal.makeSound();  // Calls the makeSound method in the Animal class

        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.makeSound();  // Calls the overridden makeSound method in the Dog class
        myDog.makeSound("Loudly");  // Calls the overloaded makeSound method in the Dog class
    }
}


Rule #2: Access Modifiers
Java limits overriding a method to access modifiers that are as accessible or more accessible
than the version in the inherited method.

Rule #3: Checked Exceptions
One implication of this rule is that overridden methods are free to declare any number of new unchecked exceptions.

Rule #4: Covariant Return Types
The overriding method must use a return type that is covariant with the return type of the inherited method.
meaning that, when you override a method from a superclass in a subclass,you can return a more specialized
type when you override a method  (sa sa vle di )Covariant return types allow you to make your code more specific
 and meaningful when you're dealing with method overriding.


 Redeclaring private Methods
Java permits you to redeclare a new method in the child class with the same or modified
signature as the method in the parent class
example:
public class Beetle {
 private String getSize() {
 return "Undefined";
 } }
public class RhinocerosBeetle extends Beetle {
 private int getSize() {
 return 5;
 } }
Notice that the return type differs in the child method from String to int. In this
example, the method getSize() in the parent class is redeclared, so the method in the child
class is a new method and not an override of the method in the parent class.

Hiding Static Methods
A static method cannot be overridden because class objects do not inherit from each other in
the same way as instance objects.However, they can be hidden.
-hidden method occurs when a child class defines a static method with the same name and signature as an
inherited static method defined in a parent class.

Rule # 5- The method defined in the child class must be marked as static if it is marked as
static in a parent class. Meaning: it is method hiding if the two methods are marked static and method overriding
if they are not marked static. If one is marked static and the other is not, the class will not compile.
Let’s review some examples of the new rule:
public class Bear {
 public static void eat() {
 System.out.println("Bear is eating");
 } }
public class Panda extends Bear {
 public static void eat() {-> it hides the eat() method in Bear class, printing "panda is chewing" @runtime
 because they are both marked as static, it is not considered as an overriden method.
 System.out.println("Panda is chewing");
 }
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 eat(); } }

-Hiding Variables
A hidden variable occurs when a child class defines a variable with the same name as an
inherited variable defined in the parent class.This creates two distinct copies of the variable
within an instance of the child class: one instance defined in the parent class and one defined
in the child class.

Inheritance: When a child class extends a parent class, it inherits all the variables and methods defined
in the parent class.

Hidden Variable: If the child class defines a variable with the same name as a variable in the parent class,
the variable in the child class hides the variable in the parent class. This means that when you access the variable
using the same name in the child class, you're referring to the child class's variable, not the parent class's variable.

example:
class Parent {
    int x = 10;
}
class Child extends Parent {
    int x = 20;
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
        System.out.println(child.x);  // This prints the child class's 'x', which is 20.

        Parent parent = new Child();
        System.out.println(parent.x);  // This also prints the child class's 'x', which is 20.
    }}
