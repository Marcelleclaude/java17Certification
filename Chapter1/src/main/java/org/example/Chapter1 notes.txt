-Defining Instance and Class Variables.
  a class variable is one that is defined on the class level and shared
among all instances of the class. It can even be publicly accessible to classes outside the
class and doesn’t require an instance to use. 

a variable is a class variable if it has the static keyword in its declaration.
Instance and class variables do not require you to initialize them. As soon as you declare
these variables, they are given a default value. The compiler doesn’t know what value to use
and so wants the simplest value it can give the type: null for an object, zero for the numeric
types, and false for a boolean.
