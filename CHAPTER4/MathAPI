-Finding the Minimum and Maximum
The min() and max() methods compare two values and return one of them.
The method signatures for min() are as follows:
public static double min(double a, double b)
public static float min(float a, float b
public static int min(int a, int b)
public static long min(long a, long b)

-The max() method works the
same way, except it returns the larger value.
The following shows how to use these methods:
int first = Math.max(3, 7); // 7
int second = Math.min(7, -9); // -9

-Rounding Numbers
The round() method gets rid of the decimal portion of the value, choosing the next higher
number if appropriate. If the fractional part is .5 or higher, we round up.
The method signatures for round() are as follows:
public static long round(double num)
public static int round(float num)

There are two overloaded methods to ensure that there is enough room to store a
rounded double if needed. The following shows how to use this method:
long low = Math.round(123.45); // 123
long high = Math.round(123.50); // 124
int fromFloat = Math.round(123.45f); // 123

-Determining the Ceiling and Floor
The ceil() method takes a double value. If it is a whole number, it returns the same
value. If it has any fractional value, it rounds up to the next whole number. By contrast, the
floor() method discards any values after the decimal.
The method signatures are as follows:
public static double ceil(double num)
public static double floor(double num)
The following shows how to use these methods:
double c = Math.ceil(3.14); // 4.0
double f = Math.floor(3.14); // 3.0

Calculating Exponents

The pow() method handles exponents
The method signature is as follows:
public static double pow(double number, double exponent).
The following shows how to use this method:
double squared = Math.pow(5, 2); // 25.0

-Generating Random Numbers
The random() method returns a value greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. The method
signature is as follows:
public static double random()
The following shows how to use this method:
double num = Math.random();
