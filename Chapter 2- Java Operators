Increment and Decrement Operators
Increment and decrement operators, ++ and --, respectively, can be applied to numeric variables and have a high order of precedence compared to binary operators. In other words,
they are often applied first in an expression.
Increment and decrement operators require special care because the order in which they
are attached to their associated variable can make a difference in how an expression is processed

Pre-increment ++w Increases the value by 1 and returns the new value
Pre-decrement --x Decreases the value by 1 and returns the new value
Post-increment y++ Increases the value by 1 and returns the original value
Post-decrement z-- Decreases the value by 1 and returns the original value

Examples:
The following code snippet illustrates this distinction:
int parkAttendance = 0;
System.out.println(parkAttendance); // 0
System.out.println(++parkAttendance); // 1
System.out.println(parkAttendance); // 1
System.out.println(parkAttendance--); // 1
System.out.println(parkAttendance); // 0

Working with Binary Arithmetic Operators
Modulus: i % j Returns the remainder after division of one numeric value by another

REMEMBER: The multiplicative operators (*, /, %) have a higher order of precedence than the
additive operators (+, -). Take a look at the following expression:
int price = 2 * 5 + 3 * 4 - 8;
First, you evaluate the 2 * 5 and 3 * 4, which reduces the expression to this:
int price = 10 + 12 - 8;
Then, you evaluate the remaining terms in left-to-right order, resulting in a value of
price of 14


So, you can change the order of the operation by adding () to it.
Changing the Order of Operation
Letâ€™s return to the previous price example. The following code snippet contains the same
values and operators, in the same order, but with two sets of parentheses added:
int price = 2 * ((5 + 3) * 4 - 8);
This time you would evaluate the addition operator 5 + 3, which reduces the expression
to the following:
int price = 2 * (8 * 4 - 8);
You can further reduce this expression by multiplying the first two values within the
parentheses:
int price = 2 * (32 - 8);
Next, you subtract the values within the parentheses before applying terms outside the
parentheses:
int price = 2 * 24;
Finally, you would multiply the result by 2, resulting in a value of 48 for price

Java, unlike some other programming languages,
does not allow brackets, [], to be used in place of parentheses.

Division and Modulus Operators
The modulus operator,
sometimes called the remainder operator, is simply the remainder when two numbers are
divided. For example, 9 divided by 3 divides evenly and has no remainder; therefore, the
result of 9 % 3 is 0. On the other hand, 11 divided by 3 does not divide evenly; therefore,
the result of 11 % 3 is 2.
The following examples illustrate this distinction:
System.out.println(9 / 3); // 3
System.out.println(9 % 3); // 0
System.out.println(10 / 3); // 3
System.out.println(10 % 3); // 1 soo here lets say you have 10 candy you want to share with 3 friends. you give each 3 candies so 3*3=9 , therefore you have 1 candy left so the modulus is one
System.out.println(11 / 3); // 3
System.out.println(11 % 3); // 2


Numeric Promotion Rules
1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the
values to the larger of the two data types.
example:
What is the data type of x * y?
int x = 1;
long y = 33;
var z = x * y;
In this case, we follow the first rule. Since one of the values is int and the other is long,
and long is larger than int,the int value x is first promoted to a long. The result z is
then a long value.
