Control flow statements break up the flow of execution by
using decision-making, looping, and branching, allowing
the application to selectively execute particular segments of code

A statement or block often serves as the target of a decision-making statement. For
example, we can prepend the decision-making if statement to these two examples:
// Single statement
if(ticketsTaken > 1)
 patrons++;
// Statement inside a block
if(ticketsTaken > 1)
{
 patrons++;
}
Again, both of these code snippets are equivalent

IF STATEMENT:
The if statement, as
shown in Figure 3.1, accomplishes this by allowing our application to execute a particular
block of code if and only if a boolean expression evaluates to true at runtime.

Else Statement:
The else operator takes a statement or block of
statements, in the same manner as the if statement. Similarly, we can append additional if
statements to an else block to arrive at a more refined example:
if(hourOfDay < 11) {
 System.out.println("Good Morning");
} else if(hourOfDay < 15) {
 System.out.println("Good Afternoon");
} else {
 System.out.println("Good Evening");
}

Shortening Code with Pattern Matching
Pattern matching is a technique of controlling program flow that only executes a section
of code that meets certain criteria. It is used in conjunction with if statements for greater
program control.

. Flow scoping
means the variable is only in scope when the compiler can definitively determine its type.

Applying switch Statements
,switch Statements s a complex decision-making structure in
which a single value is evaluated and flow is redirected to the first matching branch, known
as a case statement. If no such case statement is found that matches the value, an optional

default statement will be called. If no such default option is available, the entire switch
statement will be skipped.

e you should be aware of for the exam: a switch statement is not required to
contain any case statements. For example, this statement is perfectly valid:
switch(month) {}
