Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

Object vs. Reference
We can summarize this principle with the following two rules:
1. The type of the object determines which properties exist within the object in memory.
2. The type of the reference to the object determines which methods and variables are
accessible to the Java program.

Casting Objects
We summarize these concepts into a set of rules for you to memorize for the exam:
1. Casting a reference from a subtype to a supertype doesn’t require an explicit cast.
2. Casting a reference from a supertype to a subtype requires an explicit cast.
3. At runtime, an invalid cast of a reference to an incompatible type results in a
ClassCastException being thrown.
4. The compiler disallows casts to unrelated types.

Lemur lemur = new Lemur();
Primate primate = lemur; // Implicit Cast to supertype
Lemur lemur2 = (Lemur)primate; // Explicit Cast to subtype
Lemur lemur3 = primate; // DOES NOT COMPILE (missing cast)

The instanceof Operator
The instanceof operator can be used to check whether an object belongs to a particular class or interface
and to prevent a ClassCastException at runtime

Polymorphism and Method Overriding
polymorphism states that when you override a method, you replace all calls to it, even those defined in the parent class
Remember, you can choose to limit polymorphic behavior by marking methods final,
which prevents them from being overridden by a subclass.

Overriding vs. Hiding Members
